                    <h1>안녕하세요!!</h1>
                    <p>My name is April, just like the month. I know you're wondering, but I was not born in April. 
                        I'm Korean and German, living in Phoenix, Arizona, with a drive to prove myself in all aspects of my life. </p>

                    <p>I'm just a woman trying to make her way and picking up hobbies and friends on my way. Dancing Latin dances has made its way
                        into my heart but I have also found a new love for roller skating. Though I'm still not very sturdy on wheels, I am 
                        determined to learn because the next stop is to learn urban mushing with the love of my life, my furbaby, Lady. 
                    </p>

                    <P>My last, personal passion is taking care of my daughter, Lady. Though she came into my life under uncertain circumstances,
                        I would not give her up for the world. Teaching her a slew of adorable tricks has because one of my favorite pastimes! 
                        Please feel free to ask me for a photo (or anything) about her!
                    </P>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <div class="group">
                <div class="item item-double">
                    <p> While I majored in English, just as one would suspect, I haven't met very much success with my degree. From retail
                        to copyediting, nothing felt quite right so in January 2021 I decided to make a change and throw myself head
                        first into software engineering through a bootcamp program called Thinkful. </p>

                    <p>Learning a new trade has been incredibly humbling but I'm incredibly excited to start a career in software engineering. 
                        After working a year and a half doing Tier 1 IT Support and tinkering with CSS/HTML has paved my way to Thinkful.
                        IT was definitely a way for me to discover a new passion in coding and what better way to cultivate that than to learn even 
                        more coding languages?
                    </p>

                    <p>Thinkful has been a great learning tool to introduce me to the world of programming. I would love to get in contact
                        and start a new project or come onto a team. My skills include frontend Javascript and HTML/CSS

                    <p>My neighborhood decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. Tasked with building
                        the algorithms based on datasets, the key features is an organized dashboard that shows which books are available,
                        which are checked out, and other general statistics. This project makes use of javascript and html/css.</p>
